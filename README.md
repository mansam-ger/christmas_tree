# christmas_tree
A digital christmas tree which plays songs and lights up Neopixels by the sound of a buzzer. No cracy programmings skills but my way to express creativity/learning/fun in anything computer related.

## 3d model
As I am very bad with 3d Design, I used this model from Thingiverse and pulled a hole into the bottom to put all the electronics into the tree. I used transparent green PETG to print it on my anycubic vyper:

## Hardware
 - a Raspberry Pi Pico with Circuit Python
 - 8 single Neopixel LEDs connected with wire&solder
 - 1 LED used for LED Candles form Octo Supply
 - 1 simple pushbotton
 - 1 Buzzer
 - Gluegun + glue
 - USB-Cable for power supply
 - a wooden base for the tree
 
## Libraries 

I used simpleio and neopixel library from here https://circuitpython.org/libraries

## Plans

 - make the tree dance to the music
 - enable colorpicking, that you are able to choose colors which are used for the lightshow
 - more songs
